#' Express element distribution using comprehensive geochemical datasets
#'
#' Chelyabinsk allows you to handle comprehensive geochemical dataset.
#' As a first step, you plot REE and SPIDER diagram using appropriate
#' normalization.  Then, using both in-situ and whole-rock datasets,
#' you obtain element quantitative-distribution among phases with
#' mass-balance calculation.
